# Hello, I'm LegendLeo (Tsing)! üëã

A full-stack developer passionate about connecting everything with code. I firmly believe that AI and automation will revolutionize productivity, and I'm actively exploring how to integrate these technologies into practical applications.

My personal website is here: [https://huqing.site](https://huqing.site)

## üöÄ My Current Focus:

*   **Exploring the Power of AI:** Diving into the field of AI, understanding and applying its immense potential to enhance productivity across various industries. AI Agents, LLM applications, image/text generation, and AI-driven browser automation all excite me immensely!
*   **Process Automation:** Deeply utilizing tools like `n8n`, `Dify`, and `Coze` to build intelligent and efficient workflows in conjunction with AI. I'm keen on freeing up my hands with code, whether it's web scraping or workflow automation, I'm striving to make them smarter and more efficient.
*   **Building with React:** Primarily using React and its ecosystem to create modern, dynamic user interfaces. I'm obsessed with creating user experiences using React and Vue. TypeScript is my trusty sidekick, and Webpack is my magic wand, making code neat and organized.
*   **Back-end Explorer:** Using Node.js and other modern technologies for complete and reliable application architecture and development. Node.js and Express are my go-to tools for building servers, while Python and FastAPI are my new darlings for handling various data and logic.
*   **Serverless Player:** I love embracing the freedom of the cloud. Tencent Cloud Function and Vercel allow me to focus more on the code itself, rather than the complexities of servers.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Tech Stack:

*   **Front-end:** React, TypeScript, Vue, Webpack
*   **Back-end:** Node.js, Express, Python, FastAPI
*   **AI / Automation:** n8n, Dify, Coze
*   **Others:** Git, GitHub, Serverless, MySQL, Tencent Cloud Function, Vercel

I'm always happy to connect with friends who are passionate about AI and automation. Feel free to check out my projects or start a conversation with me anytime!
